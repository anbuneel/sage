Lender Letter LL-2024-01 – HomeReady Product Enhancement

(Updated Dec. 5, 2024) To address some of the barriers to entry for very low-income purchase borrowers, we are offering a temporary $2,500 loan-level price adjustment credit on our HomeReady® loan product. We are extending the $2,500 loan-level price adjustment credit for one additional year and updating eligibility to require at least one borrower to be a first-time homebuyer.
