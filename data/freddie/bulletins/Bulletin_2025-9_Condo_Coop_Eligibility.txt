EFFECTIVE DATE

All of the changes announced in this Bulletin are effective immediately unless otherwise noted.

CONDOMINIUM AND COOPERATIVE PROJECT TERMINATION OR INSOLVENCY

Effective for Mortgages with

Application Received Date

s on or after September 30, 2025, but Sellers may implement immediately. However, effective immediately with this Bulletin, if the Seller becomes aware that the project does not meet the requirements for projects terminating or involved in insolvency proceedings, then the project is ineligible, and the Seller must not deliver the related loan.

In consultation with FHFA, we have worked together with Fannie Mae to update our project review requirements to include projects that are terminating or involved in insolvency proceedings as an ineligible project type.

These requirements apply to all Mortgages secured by

Condominium Unit

s in

Condominium Project

s and all

Cooperative Share Loan

s secured by

Cooperative Interest

s in a

Cooperative Project

regardless of the project review type. The requirements also apply to loans eligible for delivery under Exempt From Review.

As a reminder, if a Seller or

Related Third Party

becomes aware of information that conflicts with a

Condominium Project

’s PAR findings, then pursuant to the requirements in

Guide Section 5701.10(d)(ii)

, the Seller or

Related Third Party

must notify Freddie Mac at

ProjectInfo@FreddieMac.com

with the supporting documentation within five Business Days of becoming aware of such information.

Temporary subsidy buydowns for

Mortgages

We have updated the Guide to allow temporary subsidy buydowns for Mortgages secured by

After further review, we are rescinding the requirement to use the full risk premium to calculate the housing expense-to-income and debt payment-to-income ratios for Mortgages where a flood insurance policy on the
