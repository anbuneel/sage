Eligible income includes employed earnings using paystub(s) and W-2 data and self-employed income using tax returns or tax transcript data. The Freddie Mac Income Calculator may provide relief from enforcement of certain income representations and warranties. Eligibility for income representation and warranty relief will be reflected on the

Freddie Mac Income Calculator Certificate

or the

Feedback Certificate

if submitted to Loan Product Advisor.
