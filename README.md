# SAGE — Smart Agentic Guide Engine

> **"Policy intelligence that works for you."**

SAGE is an AI-powered solution that transforms mortgage guidelines from static documents into an intelligent system that:

- **Monitors** policy changes across Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
- **Reasons** about loan scenarios and eligibility
- **Compares** GSE products side-by-side
- **Suggests** actionable fixes when loans fail eligibility
- **Generates** code updates for compliance

## The Problem

The Fannie Mae Selling Guide and Freddie Mac Seller/Servicer Guide are massive (1,200+ pages each) and change frequently. Lenders struggle to keep up with policy changes, understand eligibility, and maintain compliance.

## How SAGE Goes Beyond AskPoli

| AskPoli | SAGE |
|---------|------|
| Reactive search/Q&A | **Proactive** change monitoring |
| Text responses | **Generates code** showing rule updates |
| Finds the rule | **Reasons** about your specific loan scenario |
| Fannie Mae only | **Fannie + Freddie** comparison |

## Features

### Four Tabs

1. **Ask the Guide** — RAG-powered Q&A with citations
2. **What Changed** — Timeline of detected policy updates
3. **Generated Updates** — Code diffs for rule engine updates
4. **Check My Loan** — Scenario analyzer with fix suggestions

### Four Agentic Layers

| Agent | Function |
|-------|----------|
| Change Detection | Monitors for new Lender Letters and Bulletins |
| Impact Analyst | Compares old vs new policy semantically |
| Code Generator | Drafts rule engine updates |
| Scenario Reasoner | Analyzes loans, explains failures, suggests fixes |
